hashtag-description: "This campaign focuses on empowering women through literature. We believe reading about feminist ideas and perspectives can inspire and motivate women to make positive changes in their lives and in society. Through this campaign, we share books about feminism and analyze the first chapter in depth, providing insights and discussions that will encourage women to continue reading and exploring these important topics. We understand that every great achievement start with a first step, and the first chapter of a book can be the key to inspiring readers to continue. Join us in discovering the transformative power of literature and taking the first step towards creating a more inclusive and equitable world."
